## Introduction

This repository contains the code for the IoP Hydra Blockchain. The IoP Hydra Blockchain is an ARK bridgechain and follows upstream changes as closely as possible.
Changes to naming schemes, documentation and other auxiliary files are thus kept to a minimum. If you want to learn more about the code, check out the original code base at [@ARKEcosystem](https://github.com/ARKEcosystem/core.git).

## Contributing

PRs that are inline with our goals to the core IOP user experience are
more than welcome. To avoid losing precious time you spend on coding, you could
open an issue first and discuss what you are up to before forking and sending us
a PR.

Small note: If editing the README, please conform to the
[standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
